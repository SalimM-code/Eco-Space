# Finals_project

## Project Goal
- We are creating this project because of our shared insterest in freecycle network and zero-waste ethos, and we believe there are a ton of individual with the same passion.
- Everywhere on the planet we are far from understanding the danger linked to single use plastic products and we believe all should be replaced by sustainable products, hence a section of our web app dedicated to selling products made of environmentally sensible materials. 
- Our goal is zero waste.all the impact
- Our motto is reduce.reuse.refill.repeat.
